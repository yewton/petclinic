/**
 * Marker interface for all extensions.
 *
 * <p>An {@link Extension} can be registered <em>programmatically</em> through
 * {@link io.r2dbc.postgresql.PostgresqlConnectionConfiguration} or <em>automatically</em> using
 * the {@link java.util.ServiceLoader} mechanism.
 * <p>
 * The global extension registration through Java's {@link java.util.ServiceLoader} mechanism, allows third-party extensions to be auto-detected and automatically registered based on
 * what is available in the classpath.
 * <p>
 * Specifically, a custom extension can be registered by supplying its fully qualified class name in a file named {@code io.r2dbc.postgresql.extension.Extension} within the
 * {@code /META-INF/services} directory in its enclosing JAR file.</p>
 *
 * <strong>Configuring Automatic Extension Detection</strong>
 * <p>Auto-detection is enabled by default. To disable it, simply set the {@link io.r2dbc.postgresql.PostgresqlConnectionConfiguration.Builder#autodetectExtensions(boolean)} parameter to
 * {@code false}.</p>
 *
 * <strong>Constructor Requirements</strong>
 * <p>Extension implementations must have a <em>default constructor</em> if registered via the {@code ServiceLoader}.  When registered through
 * {@link io.r2dbc.postgresql.PostgresqlConnectionConfiguration} the default constructor is not required to be {@code public}.
 * When registered via the {@code ServiceLoader} the default constructor must be {@code public}.
